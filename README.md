# Model identification with symbolic algebra
This repo will be filled with code to check whether a model is locally identified using symbolic algebra. Other approaches, such as `mxCheckIdentification()` in OpenMx check the rank of the Jacobian numerically, requiring a *fitted* model. When model fitting is time consuming, it may be desirable to know whether a model is identified before fitting it. That is the idea of this project which is inspired by the 2010 paper by [Bollen and Bauldry](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0049124110366238) where they propose exactly this approach. I am planning to try it first using [Ryacas](10.32614/CRAN.package.Ryacas), the way to go when you want to do symbolic algebra in R. It might be necessary to switch to [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) (the Python version). But let's see first.
